## Technical Skills

### Navigation
All navigation in the app was made with [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org/) using Stack Navigator for Authentication routes and Bottom Tabs for Authenticated routes, on Bottom Tabs 
navigator was used 3 tabs: Home, History and Profile, but 4 screens, that includes the Exercise Details, all the management for now show the 4th icon was made.

### Form Control
For form management was used the [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) form make the proccess way easier to develop and to make the code readable for everyone.
Using controled components and hooks from the RH-form, save the app to use a lot of states and save us making way more easy to use `validation` (that was validated using [Yup](https://github.com/jquense/yup))
also saving us to use state for LoadingRequest states with the use of 'isSubmiting' and meke our life easier with the errors states of the fields.

### Component Library
The component library used was the [Native Base](https://nativebase.io/) a utility-first component library, where you can style you component as props inside of the 
components of the library. Provide us a very complete [theme library](https://docs.nativebase.io/default-theme) with quick change between light/dark mode and also provide
us a very simple and powerful Toast component that is totally customizable.

### Data fetching
The data fetching proccess is all made with [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro) using `interceptors` to convert error messages and anso implemented a `Refresh Token`
proccess. In the future the plan is integrate with [Tanstack query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/) for quick data caching and smarter manageement of data.

## Future plans
 - [ ] Integrate with Tanstack query
 - [ ] Internacionalization - Automatically detect your language and then changes the app language to it. Initially (PT-BR, EN-UK)
